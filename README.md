## Self-Development with Django API and React
```
Have you always wanted to create your own application, 
a display of your skills, a project which can be implemented in the real world scenario? 
Welcome to our Self-Development section; you can finally create your own application! 
There are some conditions to be followed for the best results, 
think about your interest and how it can help the world, be flexible to change according to requirements
and create an interactive and which can be implemented for day to day usage.
```

## Project flow 
```
Most of us imagine creating an app to be an innate talent. 
In some cases, it's true, and most times, it is an internal journey 
and carefully explored process that can be the inception of a great app! 
We recommend you take this self-exploratory journey to analyze your resources, 
research implementation methods as required by the industry. 
We believe that this gives you a holistic approach 
when you are looking to create something new.Â 
Usually, the development period for the project is 2 weeks. 
Therefore, even if you have a comprehensive idea, start by focusing on the most important function. 
This is our guideline schedule, and it can help you stay focused and work towards your goal!
```
* DAY 1: Choose a project available and Collect your design from your Tutor. The tutor will explain the flow of the project.
* DAY 2: Cloning, Downloading and Deployment of QuickStart App as a reference project.
* DAY 3-6: Understand the Design and convert the pages from Adobe XD into HTML and CSS after making a plan for the same.
* DAY 7-9: Completion of the Django API which forms the backend part of our project
* DAY 9-12: Adding Functionality to the project in frontend using REACT and REDUX
* DAY 13: After testing the code and receiving feedback from tutor, rectify/fix any bugs that exist.
* DAY 14: Checking Deployment of Project on Heroku including debugging and testing.
* DAY 15: Update Portfolio and post project URL in LinkedIn. [Ref: ]

## Let's define the requirements of the idea
```
Ideas can sometimes be cryptic. They need to be organized to reach a successful conclusion. 
To see the fruition of an idea, we all know that one needs to define the action plan. 
In this section, we have summarised the steps that can catalyze your process. 
Once you've got an idea, answer the following questions to achieve this clarity. 
These answers will be the BRD(Business Requirements Document) for your system. 
Now, create a card in Trello and write it as a "Project Summary."
```

1. What is the service name?
2. Who uses it?
3. What do you offer?
4. What is your purpose?
5. What kind of function does it have?
    1. Itemize the functions.
    2. Prioritize functions.

## How to submit your assignment

1. Feel free to ask for feedback on any steps. Our experts are happy to help you achieve your goal! 
2. When you're done, submit the Adobe XD & Github & Heroku URL to your tutor.
