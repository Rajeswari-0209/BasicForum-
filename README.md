## Project flow 
```
Most of us imagine creating an app to be an innate talent. 
In some cases, it's true, and most times, it is an internal journey 
and carefully explored process that can be the inception of a great app! 
We recommend you take this self-exploratory journey to analyze your resources, 
research implementation methods as required by the industry. 
We believe that this gives you a holistic approach 
when you are looking to create something new.Â 
Usually, the development period for the project is 2 weeks. 
Therefore, even if you have a comprehensive idea, start by focusing on the most important function. 
This is our guideline schedule, and it can help you stay focused and work towards your goal!
